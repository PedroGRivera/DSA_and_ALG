    Your task is to implement a CLI. 
    This cli must allow the user to add an item to a todo list, 
    view the top item on the list, remove the top item from the list,
    or exit the program.

    Below I have imported the stack class from task1. you should be
    able to create an instance of the class using a line similar to:
        s = stack()
    See the testing section at the bottom of task 1 for more ideas
    of how to use the class if you get stuck.

    *NOTE: This task will be a bit more free-form and that is often
    a lot harder to do. The best way to tackle this is start simple 
    and add more from there. If you happen to really not like this
    task, I want you to think about other things a stack may be useful
    for and try and recrate something like that. And if you find that
    it is too easy, think about what would be a fun thing to add that
    may up the challenge for you a bit.*
